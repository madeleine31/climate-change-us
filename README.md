# Climate Change U.S.
Climate change in the United States

## Summary
This project will analyze climate data from major U.S. cities, representing various regions, with two major goals. The first will be to create visualizations to convey to the public any patterns in the data. The second will be to explore regional differences to better understand local impacts of climate change. We will use data on temperature, precipitation, and wind speed from NOAAâ€™a web site.

## Contribution
Develop interesting visualizations to clearly communicate findings.
Approaching climate data from a more local perspective may help to better understand how different communities have been impacted.

## Challenges
Many studies of climate change have already been conducted and there are a lot of great climate data visualizations out there. How will this project contribute something new?
