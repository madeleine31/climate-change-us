Climate change in the U.S.

Summary: 
This project will look at impacts of climate change in the U.S., specifically in terms of biodiversity, as evidenced by data from national parks. Currently, the focus is on Acadia National Park, Maine.

Contribution:
Enhance our understanding of effects of climate change on biodiversity.
Develop interesting visualizations to clearly communicate findings.

Challenges:
How to approach statistical analysis of multiple overlapping vector layers?
Many studies of climate change have already been conducted and there are a lot of great climate data visualizations out there. This project will attempt to contribute something new by creating visualizations and conducting statistical analyses to help answer questions regarding effects of climate change on speciesâ€™ ranges.
